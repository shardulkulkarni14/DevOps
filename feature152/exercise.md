# Exercise

Develop a Dockerfile

```Docker
Dockerfile.main.df
```

A container will be build from it and invoked using the
following procedure

```sh
cd feature152
docker build -t feature152.main -f Dockerfile.main.df .
docker run --rm --name server.local \
       feature152.main /bin/sh
docker exec server.local <a commmand to start the web server>
```

So **no** docker `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD` directives are needed.
The container should be developed according to the description below
(cp. 'Task').

(Git) stage, commit, and push your changes (the Docker file) to feature
branch 'feature152'. Check, if the green check-mark appears in the
Gitea Web application at feature branch 'feature152'. If it appears,
submit a pull request via the Gitea Web application. If not, check your code.
It did not pass the tests.

#### Task


Taking Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image, the container should install
and setup Caddy as a Web server. The Web server should deliver its
default Web page.


The running image will be checked for

- using the correct Web server to serve Web pages,
- running on Ubuntu, and
- serving the Web server's default welcome page when called under

```sh
http://server.local
```
